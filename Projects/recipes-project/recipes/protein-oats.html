                Protein oatmeal is a great way to start your day - it provides
                you with the complex carbohydrates necessary to keep you
                energised throughout the day, and the added protein powder 
                helps with reaching your daily protein intake goals.
                <br><br>
                It is important to note that to get maximum benefits from 
                your oats, the protein powder must be ACAI flavoured. ACAI is 
                known to make people massive naturally. Just take a look at
                Gordon Ryan, he's jacked as hell and attributes all of his success
                to his consumptino of acai <em>and use of steroids</em>.
